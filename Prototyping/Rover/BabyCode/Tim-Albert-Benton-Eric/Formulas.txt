Formula to maintain current turning angle

Constants:

l_front = distance from front wheels to middle joint
l_back = distance from back wheels to middle joint
width = distance between right and left wheels

Inputs:

angle = current angle of middle joint (0 is straight forward, positive is turn right, negative is turn left)
v = target speed

Calculations:

(front turning radius)
r_front = (l_back + (l_front * cos(angle))) / sin(angle)
(back turning radius)
r_back = (l_front + (l_back * cos(angle))) / sin(angle)

Output:

front_left_v = v * (1 + (width / (2 * r_front)))
front_right_v = v * (1 - (width / (2 * r_front)))
back_left_v = v * (1 + (width / (2 * r_back)))
back_right_v = v * (1 - (width / (2 * r_back)))
